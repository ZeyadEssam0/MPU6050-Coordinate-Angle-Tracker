Components Required
MPU6050: A 6-axis motion sensing module (accelerometer and gyroscope).
Arduino Uno
Jumper Wires
Breadboard

Software Required
Arduino IDE: To program the Arduino Uno and upload the code.
MPU6050 Library: The project uses the MPU6050 library to interface with the sensor and read data from it.

Installation
1-Install the MPU6050 Library: Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.... Search for MPU6050 and install the library by Jeff Rowberg
2-Upload the Code: Open the provided .ino file in the Arduino IDE, and upload it to your Arduino Uno board.
3-Open the Serial Monitor: After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (set baud rate to 115200) to view the output, including the real-time angles (pitch, roll, yaw) and detected coordinates.
